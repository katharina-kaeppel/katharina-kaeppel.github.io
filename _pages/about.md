I am a first year PhD student at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) under the supervision of [Thomas Breda](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/breda-thomas/index_en.html) and [Marc Gurgand](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/persons/marc-gurgand/). I also work part time as a Senior Research and Policy Associate at [J-PAL Europe](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/j-pal-europe). 

My research interests lie in gender and labor economics as well as applied econometrics. 

Prior to starting the PhD, I worked one year as part of J-PAL's team at the MIT headquarters, and one year as a Research Manager at the [Center for Evaluation and Development](https://c4ed.org/) in Mannheim, Germany. I hold a MSc on Analysis and Policy in Economics from Paris School of Economics and the [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en). I also obtained a dual master's degree in International Development from [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/fr/) and Political Economy of Emerging Markets from [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/), and an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Goethe University Frankfurt](uni-frankfurt.de/en?) in Germany.
